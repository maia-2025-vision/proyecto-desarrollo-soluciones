# sort_paths: false means we will load images
# in the order produced by data_root_dir.rglob()
# this might depend on the operating system or
# the order in which images were saved on disk
# This also causes some data-leakage between
# train and validation, since it's very likely
# that some (most?) validation image have big overlap
# with train set. This validation metrics
# will be inflated and unrealistic because of this.
# So, although this yields a model with a higher
# IoU, that IoU is not representative of actual
# model performance on a separate test dataset.
